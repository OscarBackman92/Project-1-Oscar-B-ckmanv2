## About
At The Waffle Truck, we are passionate about creating the perfect waffles. Our journey began in 2018 when we met on a blind date over waffles at a spring market. Since then, waffles have become our shared passion. We noticed a lack of good waffle places in Stockholm, especially in Jakobsberg, and thus The Waffle Truck was born.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to provide a wide menu of well-composed combinations of fantastic ingredients and innovative flavor combinations that suit everyone. We aim to make our guests happy with good food, accessibility, proximity, and pleasant treatment.
